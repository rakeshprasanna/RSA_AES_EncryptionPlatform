# Java Encryption Software

This repository contains a simple Java software program designed to encrypt text and images using RSA and AES algorithms.

## Description

This program allows users to encrypt and decrypt text and images using RSA and AES. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a public-key encryption algorithm, widely used for secure data transmission. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm that provides high-speed and secure data encryption and decryption.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <https://github.com/rakeshprasanna/RSA_AES_EncryptionPlatform.git>`
2. Navigate to the directory: `src/main/java/com/javasrc`
3. Compile the Java files: `javac *.java`
4. Run the program: `java MainClass`

## Usage

Provide the text or the path to the image you want to encrypt. The program will output the encrypted data. To decrypt, input the encrypted data and the program will output the decrypted text or image.
